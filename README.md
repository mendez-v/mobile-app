## *The goal*

ðŸŽ¯ Build an app that allows values to be entered and rendered in the app and stored in a real-time Firebase database. 

ðŸŽ¯ When a value is deleted, it is deleted from both the rendering and the database.

## *What I learnt*

ðŸ”° `import` -  is used to import read-only live bindings which are exported by another module.

These two lines import specific functions from Firebase.
+ `initializeApp` is used to initialize a Firebase application.

+ `getDatabase`, `ref`, `push`, `onValue`, and `remove` are functions that interact with the Firebase real-time database.
```js
import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.15.0/firebase-app.js"
import { getDatabase, ref, push, onValue, remove } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.15.0/firebase-database.js"
```

ðŸ”° Application configuration - ***databaseURL*** is the URL of the Firebase real-time database.
```js
const appSettings = {
  databaseURL: "https://shopping-cart-34f59-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/"
}
```

ðŸ”° Initialises the Firebase application with the previously defined configuration.
```js
const app = initializeApp(appSettings)
```

ðŸ”° Getting the database -
```js
const database = getDatabase(app)
```

ðŸ”° Reference to shopping list - This reference can be used to read or write data to that location in the database.
```js
const shoppingListInDB = ref(database, "shoppingList")
```

ðŸ”° Listening for database changes - `onValue` function listens for real-time changes in the database, it takes two arguments:

1. a reference to the database (in this case, ***shoppingListInDB***) and,

1. a callback function that is executed whenever the data in that reference changes. 
    1. ***snapshot*** is an object containing the current data in that reference.
```js
onValue(shoppingListInDB, function(snapshot) {
  // code
})
```

ðŸ”° The `exists` function checks if there is any data in the snapshot. If there is data, the code inside the if block will be executed.
```js
if (snapshot.exists()) {
  // code
}
```

ðŸ”° Converting the data into an array:
+ `snapshot.val()` returns the current data in snapshot as a JavaScript object. 

+ `Object.entries` converts this object into an array of arrays, where each subarray contains a ***key*** and a ***value*** from the original object.
```js
let itemsArr = Object.entries(snapshot.val())
```

ðŸ”° Creating a reference to an item in the database:

+ The `ref` function creates a reference to a specific location in the Firebase database. In this case, the location is `shoppingList/${itemID}`, where 

+ `${itemID}` is a variable representing the ID of the item in the shopping list.

```js
let exactLocationOfItemInDB = ref(database, `shoppingList/${itemID}`)
```

ðŸ”° Removing the item from the database:

+ `remove` function removes the data at the location specified by the reference. In this case, the shopping list item with the ***ID ${itemID}*** will be removed.

```js
remove(exactLocationOfItemInDB)
```
